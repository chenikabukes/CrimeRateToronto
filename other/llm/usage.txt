Can you change this so that there is one plot with subplots for each of the individual crimes:

# Join the crime data with the top-bottom neighborhood data to get neighborhood type labels
crime_high_low <- crime_high_low %>%
  left_join(top_bottom_neighborhoods, by = c("hood_id" = "neighbourhood_code"))

# Group by crime type, neighborhood type, and year to calculate the average crime rate
crime_high_low_summary <- crime_high_low %>%
  group_by(crime, neighbourhood_type, year) %>%
  summarise(avg_crime_rate = mean(rate, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = 'drop')

# Generate a separate plot for each crime type
for (crime_type in crimes_to_investigate) {
  
  # Filter for the specific crime type
  crime_data <- crime_high_low_summary %>%
    filter(crime == crime_type)
  
  # Create the plot
  plot <- ggplot(crime_data, aes(x = year, y = avg_crime_rate, fill = neighbourhood_type)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
    labs(
      title = paste("Crime Rate for", crime_type, "by Year (Top 10 vs Bottom 10 Neighborhoods)"),
      x = "Year",
      y = "Average Crime Rate per 100,000 Residents",
      fill = "Neighborhood Type"
    ) +
    theme_minimal() +

    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 10))
  
  # Print the plot

To modify the code to create a single plot with subplots for each crime type, you can use facet_wrap() or facet_grid() in ggplot2 to generate multiple panels within one plot. Here's an updated version of your code:

r
Copy code
# Join the crime data with the top-bottom neighborhood data to get neighborhood type labels
crime_high_low <- crime_high_low %>%
  left_join(top_bottom_neighborhoods, by = c("hood_id" = "neighbourhood_code"))

# Group by crime type, neighborhood type, and year to calculate the average crime rate
crime_high_low_summary <- crime_high_low %>%
  group_by(crime, neighbourhood_type, year) %>%
  summarise(avg_crime_rate = mean(rate, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = 'drop')

# Create a plot with facets for each crime type
plot <- ggplot(crime_high_low_summary, aes(x = year, y = avg_crime_rate, fill = neighbourhood_type)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  labs(
    title = "Crime Rates by Year (Top 10 vs Bottom 10 Neighborhoods)",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Average Crime Rate per 100,000 Residents",
    fill = "Neighborhood Type"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Top 10" = "blue", "Bottom 10" = "red")) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 10)) +
  facet_wrap(~ crime, ncol = 2)  # Adjust ncol to control the number of columns in the plot grid

# Print the plot
print(plot)
Explanation:
facet_wrap(~ crime, ncol = 2): This line splits the plot into subplots based on the crime type. The ncol = 2 controls the number of columns for the grid layout, but you can adjust it depending on how many subplots you want in each row.
The rest of the code remains the same but will now generate a single plot with multiple subplots, one for each crime type.
This approach should give you one combined plot with subplots, each displaying data for different crime types.

I want to write a test that checks the average crime rates are consistently higher for the bottom 10 home price neighborhoods in the simulated data vs the top 10 home price neighborhoods. I've checked my data and am pretty sure the current test I have should not be failing based on the data, can you see an issue in my test which makes it not properly test what I want it to?
average_crime_rates <- simulated_data %>%
  summarise(Average_Crime_Rate = mean(Rate))

bottom_10_avg <- average_crime_rates %>%
  filter(Group == "Bottom 10") %>%
  summarise(Bottom_10_Avg_Crime = mean(Average_Crime_Rate))

top_10_avg <- average_crime_rates %>%
  filter(Group == "Top 10") %>%

The issue in your test lies in how you are calculating the average_crime_rates initially. Specifically, you are computing the average crime rate over all the data without considering the grouping by neighborhood type (i.e., "Top 10" vs. "Bottom 10"). This results in incorrect comparisons later on when filtering for the top and bottom groups, because you're working with a single overall average instead of averages for each group.

Here's a corrected version of your test:

r
Copy code
# Summarize the average crime rate by Group (Top 10 vs Bottom 10)
average_crime_rates <- simulated_data %>%
  group_by(Group) %>%
  summarise(Average_Crime_Rate = mean(Rate, na.rm = TRUE))  # Calculate group-wise average crime rate

# Extract the average crime rate for the Bottom 10 neighborhoods
bottom_10_avg <- average_crime_rates %>%
  filter(Group == "Bottom 10") %>%
  pull(Average_Crime_Rate)  # Extract the value directly

# Extract the average crime rate for the Top 10 neighborhoods
top_10_avg <- average_crime_rates %>%
  filter(Group == "Top 10") %>%
  pull(Average_Crime_Rate)  # Extract the value directly

# Test if the average crime rate in Bottom 10 is higher than in Top 10
test_higher_bottom_10 <- bottom_10_avg > top_10_avg

# Display the test result
if (!test_higher_bottom_10) {
  stop("Test 3 failed: Bottom 10 neighborhoods do not have consistently higher average crime rates than Top 10 neighborhoods.")
} else {
  message("Test 3 passed: Bottom 10 neighborhoods have consistently higher average crime rates than Top 10 neighborhoods.")
}
Explanation of Changes:
Grouping:
In the original code, the first summarise() calculates a single overall average crime rate, which is not split by the "Top 10" vs "Bottom 10" groups.
The corrected version groups the data by Group using group_by(Group), so that you calculate the average crime rate for each neighborhood type.
Pulling values:
Instead of summarizing after filtering, you can directly extract the average values using pull(), which simplifies the code and ensures you're working with scalar values for comparison.
This corrected version ensures that the test properly checks whether the average crime rate in "Bottom 10" neighborhoods is consistently higher than in "Top 10" neighborhoods.

Can you make my discussion section more succinct, I don't want it to be too short, but remove any repetition:
# Discussion

This analysis confirms the hypothesis that wealthier neighborhoods experience lower rates of violent crimes, while economically disadvantaged areas face greater exposure to violent crime. However, non-violent crimes seem more prevalent in wealthier neighborhoods, suggesting different socio-economic dynamics at play.

The analysis of crime rates from 2014 to 2023 across Toronto's neighborhoods, focusing on the top 10 highest and bottom 10 lowest-priced neighborhoods, reveals significant disparities in crime patterns based on socioeconomic status. The results highlight a clear trend where violent crimes—such as assault, homicide, and shootings—are more prevalent in lower-priced neighborhoods, suggesting a direct correlation between economic disadvantage and exposure to violence. On the other hand, non-violent crimes like thefts (especially bike thefts and theft from motor vehicles) are more common in wealthier areas, reflecting different crime dynamics in these neighborhoods.

Key observations include:

- **Violent Crimes**: Assault, shootings, and homicides show higher rates in low-priced neighborhoods, with noticeable outliers and variability, indicating potentially greater social instability.

- **Non-Violent Crimes**: Higher-priced neighborhoods experience more theft-related crimes, likely due to the presence of higher-value targets.

- **Temporal Trends**: There is a city-wide spike in crime rates in 2023, following a period of lower crime during the 2020–2021 COVID-19 lockdowns, emphasizing the complex interactions between public health crises and crime patterns.

These findings suggest that public policy should be tailored to address the specific needs of different economic groups. Low-income neighborhoods require increased focus on violence prevention, while higher-income areas might benefit from enhanced property crime deterrence. Moreover, the evidence points to the need for long-term, community-based crime reduction strategies that consider the broader social and economic factors contributing to crime.

Future work should focus on expanding the scope of the analysis to include more socioeconomic indicators, such as employment rates and education levels, to better understand the root causes of crime and inform more effective policy interventions.

Here's a more succinct version of your discussion that removes repetition while maintaining clarity:

Discussion
This analysis supports the hypothesis that wealthier neighborhoods experience lower rates of violent crimes, while economically disadvantaged areas face higher exposure. In contrast, non-violent crimes are more prevalent in wealthier neighborhoods, suggesting different socio-economic factors at play.

From 2014 to 2023, violent crimes such as assault, homicide, and shootings were consistently higher in lower-priced neighborhoods, indicating a link between economic disadvantage and violence. Conversely, wealthier areas saw more non-violent crimes, like thefts, likely due to the presence of higher-value targets.

Key observations include:

Violent Crimes: Assaults, shootings, and homicides were more common in low-priced neighborhoods, with significant variability suggesting greater social instability.
Non-Violent Crimes: Theft-related crimes were higher in wealthier areas, reflecting different crime dynamics.
Temporal Trends: A city-wide crime spike in 2023, following lower rates during the 2020–2021 COVID-19 lockdowns, highlights the impact of public health crises on crime.
These findings suggest that public policy should focus on violence prevention in low-income areas and property crime deterrence in wealthier neighborhoods. Long-term, community-based strategies that consider broader socio-economic factors are essential for effective crime reduction.

Future work should incorporate more socioeconomic indicators, such as employment and education, to deepen understanding and improve policy interventions.

This version removes redundant phrases and tightens the focus while preserving the key points.

To fix the issue of the chart title going off the screen and the overlapping x-axis labels in your PDF rendering, you can make the following adjustments:

Adjust the title size: Reduce the size of the chart title to prevent it from overflowing.
Increase the figure width: This gives the x-axis labels more space, reducing the chance of overlap.
Further adjust x-axis label rotation: You can try rotating them more or adjusting the position for better readability.
Use ggsave() to manually control figure size: This ensures the chart is appropriately sized in the PDF output.
Here’s an updated version of your code incorporating these adjustments:

r
Copy code
# Summarize crime data by calculating the mean rate for each crime type and year
crime_summary <- crime_cleaned_data %>%
  group_by(crime, year) %>%
  summarise(Mean_Rate = mean(rate, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ungroup()

# Create a bar plot for each crime type by year
p <- ggplot(crime_summary, aes(x = factor(year), y = Mean_Rate, fill = crime)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  facet_wrap(~ crime, scales = "free_y") +  
  labs(title = "Mean Crime Rates by Year (2014-2023) for Each Crime Type",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Mean Crime Rate per 100,000 Residents",
       fill = "Crime Type") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1, vjust = 1, size = 8),  # Adjust x-axis labels
    plot.title = element_text(size = 10),  # Reduce the title size
    strip.text = element_text(size = 8)  # Adjust facet labels if needed
  )

# Save the plot with adjusted width and height for better PDF rendering
ggsave("crime_plot.pdf", plot = p, width = 10, height = 8)
Key Changes:
plot.title = element_text(size = 10): Reduces the title font size to prevent it from going off-screen.
ggsave(): Saves the plot with a specified width and height, ensuring proper layout in the PDF.
axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1, vjust = 1, size = 8): Rotates the x-axis labels for better readability.
These changes should resolve the issues when rendering the plot as a PDF in your qmd file.

Can you give example use cases for the purrr package in R

ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT
The purrr package in R is part of the tidyverse and provides a set of functional programming tools that make it easier to work with lists and vectors. It is often used for iterating over elements, applying functions, and transforming data in a more readable and efficient way than using base R functions like apply(), lapply(), or for loops. Here are some common use cases for purrr along with examples:

1. Apply Functions to Lists or Data Frames (map())
map() applies a function to each element of a list or vector and returns the results as a list.

Use case: Apply a function to each column of a data frame.

r
Copy code
library(purrr)

# Example data frame
df <- data.frame(a = 1:5, b = 6:10, c = 11:15)

# Calculate the mean for each column
means <- map(df, mean)
print(means)  # Returns a list of means for each column
2. Simplify Results from a List (map_dbl(), map_chr(), etc.)
You can use type-specific functions to simplify the result from a list to a specific vector type (e.g., double, character).

Use case: Extract the mean from a list of numeric vectors and return as a numeric vector.

r
Copy code
# Apply the mean and return as a numeric vector
means <- map_dbl(df, mean)
print(means)  # Returns a numeric vector of means
3. Safely Apply Functions to Handle Errors (safely())
purrr::safely() wraps a function so that it returns a list with both the result and any error that occurred, which prevents crashes and allows error handling.

Use case: Safely apply a function that may cause an error to each element in a list.

r
Copy code
# A vector where some operations will cause an error
vec <- list(10, "a", 20)

# Use safely to avoid errors during application
safe_log <- safely(log)

# Apply the safe log function to the list
result <- map(vec, safe_log)

# See the results and errors
print(result)  # Each element contains a result or an error
4. Apply a Function with Multiple Inputs (pmap())
pmap() allows you to apply a function to multiple inputs (i.e., multiple columns in a data frame or multiple lists).

Use case: Add values from multiple columns of a data frame row-wise.

r
Copy code
# Example data frame
df <- data.frame(x = 1:3, y = 4:6, z = 7:9)

# Apply a function to sum each row
row_sums <- pmap(df, function(x, y, z) x + y + z)
print(row_sums)  # Returns a list of row sums
5. Repeated Operations (map2() and imap())
map2() and imap() allow you to iterate over two lists or a list with indices.

Use case: Perform operations on paired elements of two vectors.

r
Copy code
# Two vectors
vec1 <- 1:5
vec2 <- 6:10

# Add corresponding elements of vec1 and vec2
sums <- map2(vec1, vec2, ~ .x + .y)
print(sums)  # Returns a list of sums of corresponding elements
6. Flattening Lists (flatten() and reduce())
flatten() and reduce() help in collapsing lists into simpler structures.

Use case: Flatten a list of lists into a single vector.

r
Copy code
# A list of lists
nested_list <- list(list(1, 2), list(3, 4), list(5, 6))

# Flatten the list of lists into a single vector
flat_list <- flatten(nested_list)
print(flat_list)  # Returns a single vector of values
7. Mapping Over a Nested List (map_df() and map_dfr())
map_df() and map_dfr() apply a function to a list and return the result as a data frame or row-bind the results.

Use case: Apply a function that returns a data frame to each element and combine the results.

r
Copy code
# A list of numeric vectors
list_of_vectors <- list(a = c(1, 2), b = c(3, 4), c = c(5, 6))

# Apply a function that creates a data frame and row-bind the results
df_result <- map_dfr(list_of_vectors, ~ data.frame(Value = .x))
print(df_result)  # Returns a combined data frame
8. Conditional Mapping (map_if() and map_at())
map_if() applies a function conditionally to elements based on a predicate.

Use case: Apply a function only to numeric columns in a data frame.

r
Copy code
# Example data frame
df <- data.frame(a = 1:5, b = letters[1:5], c = 6:10)

# Apply sqrt only to numeric columns
result <- map_if(df, is.numeric, sqrt)
print(result)  # Returns a list with sqrt applied to numeric columns
9. Accumulate Results (accumulate())
accumulate() applies a function to successive elements, returning intermediate results.

Use case: Generate cumulative sums from a vector.

r
Copy code
# A vector of numbers
nums <- 1:5

# Compute cumulative sums
cumulative_sums <- accumulate(nums, `+`)
print(cumulative_sums)  # Returns a list of cumulative sums
Summary
purrr is a highly flexible package, making it ideal for transforming lists and data frames, applying functions to multiple inputs, handling errors safely, and simplifying results. These use cases illustrate how purrr can enhance efficiency and readability in R scripts, especially when working with complex data structures.
