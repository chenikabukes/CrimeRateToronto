# Analysis of Crime Statistics and Home Price Data in Toronto (2014â€“2023)

## Overview

This repository contains the code and final report for the empirical analysis of crime statistics and home prices in Toronto from 2014 to 2023. The analysis investigates crime trends across different socioeconomic neighborhoods, focusing on the top 10 highest and bottom 10 lowest home price neighborhoods. The goal is to examine how crime rates vary based on neighborhood affluence, particularly in relation to violent and non-violent crimes.


## File Structure

The repo is structured as:

-   `data/raw_data` contains the raw datasets for crime statistics and home prices as obtained from open data portal Toronto.
-   `data/simulated_data` contains the simulated datasets for crime rates and home prices, used in the analysis.
-   `data/analysis_data` contains the cleaned datasets that were used for the final analysis.
-   `other` contains details about interactions with large language models (LLMs) during development, as well as initial project sketches.
-   `paper` contains the files used to generate the research paper, including the Quarto document, bibliography, and the final PDF of the paper.
-   `scripts` contains the R scripts used to simulate, download, clean, and test the data.


## Statement on LLM usage

Portions of the code were developed with assistance from ChatGPT-4. It was used to provide comments on scripts, resolve display issues with plots in the final paper, and refine lengthy statements into more concise language.
